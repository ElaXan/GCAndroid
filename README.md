# Note

Unfortunately, my phone has died again, and as a result, I have to stop working on this project. I do not plan to update it in the future, even though I have created new code using Python and optimized the existing code. It's worth remembering that GCAndroid is only a tool designed to install Grasscutter on your Android device.

For those who are curious, I used a Poco X3 Pro for this project, which is an excellent phone. However, I recently had an issue with it, and I took it to the service center, but unfortunately, they were not able to fix it effectively. I had to pay over $50, but the problem still persists.
